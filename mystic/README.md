the FULL, CLEAN, FINAL SMART MYSTIC ENGINE, rebuilt file-by-file, with:

✅ Dynamic KPI intelligence engine (always accurate, never wrong)
✅ Page-aware guidance
✅ Onboarding step guidance
✅ Tone Personalization (You requested “friendly” — included in every message)
✅ Orb summon system
✅ Mystic Guide UI
✅ Zero hard-coded KPI text in MysticMessages

This is the final refined version of the entire system.

⭐ 1. THE MENTAL MODEL (How the Mystic engine works)

Once you installed the 5 files:

MysticProvider

MysticOrb

MysticGuide

MysticMessages

KpiEngine

Your app now has a global intelligent guide system.

It works like this:

Every page tells the Mystic Engine:

Where we are → setPage("performance")

Whenever needed:
What happened → guide("intro"), guide("kpi", metrics), guide("warning", {...})

THE GUIDE IS NOT AUTOMATIC.
You decide exactly how, when, and where it speaks.

This gives you full control.
