⭐ CONFIDENCE SCORE — EXPLANATION (for your UI)
What is the Confidence Score?

The Confidence Score represents how certain the AI model is about the valuation produced based on:

Quality of the inputs (accurate, complete, reasonable)

Internal consistency between numbers

Market alignment of cost components

Presence of depreciation / obsolescence signals

Variance between costs and typical construction benchmarks

It ranges from 0% to 100%.

⭐ Scale Explanation (User-Friendly)
90–100% — High Confidence

Inputs are consistent

Construction costs, depreciation, and profit margins match typical market data

Few risk signals detected

Valuation is highly stable

70–89% — Medium Confidence

Inputs are valid but show moderate variability

Some depreciation or obsolescence factors require consideration

Still reliable, but user should review assumptions

40–69% — Low Confidence

Several inputs deviate from typical market ranges

Obsolescence or depreciation is unusually large

Unusual mix of costs may distort valuation

User should re-check assumptions

0–39% — Very Low Confidence

Inputs are incomplete or extreme

Numbers conflict with one another

System believes valuation stability is weak

Strongly recommend adjusting inputs


⭐ HOW THE CONFIDENCE SCORE IS CALCULATED (User-Friendly + Professional)

The Confidence Score is derived from five internal checks—each evaluated by the AI model during the Cost Approach analysis.

The five components:
1️⃣ Input Completeness (20%)

Checks whether essential fields are filled and non-zero:

Land value

Building area

Construction cost

Depreciation

Obsolescence inputs

More complete inputs = higher score.

2️⃣ Input Realism (25%)

Evaluates whether values fall within typical construction and appraisal ranges, such as:

Construction cost per sq ft

Physical depreciation levels

Entrepreneurial profit margin

Obsolescence percentages

Unusual or extreme values lower the score.

3️⃣ Market Alignment (20%)

The AI compares inputs to typical ranges seen in:

Regional construction markets

National cost databases

Typical improvement costs

Market depreciation norms

The more aligned → the higher the confidence.

4️⃣ Internal Consistency (20%)

Checks whether the numbers make sense relative to each other:

Does the building area × construction cost reflect typical replacement cost?

Is depreciation proportional to the expected age/condition?

Are site improvements reasonable relative to land value?

Is entrepreneurial profit realistic?

If inputs contradict each other, the score drops.

5️⃣ Risk & Variability Flags (15%)

Assesses risk signals:

High obsolescence

Extremely low or high profit margin

Very large depreciation

Multiple cost categories out of typical range

High construction cost variance

More flags = lower score.
